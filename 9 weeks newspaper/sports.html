                <p id="ptag">The art club is currently working on a future project that is repeated every year.</p>
                <p>This project consists of an art exhibition that will be happening in Ciudad Juarez where many
                    students will be creating art pieces and they will be put up for
                    everyone to see in there. However this year it may not be called the same, so we will update the
                    exhibition's name once we confirm it.</p>

                <h2>Art in LPI</h2>
                <p>In LPI we value art, thats why we have both a class and a club dedicated to it.</p>
                <p>In our art classroom the walls are filled with differet projects our students have done over
                    time. LPI is a place where you can demonstrate your creativity in many different ways.</p>

                <h2>Grid assignment</h2>
                <p>As some of us may already know, some the current art classes are taking an assignment on "the
                    grid method" <br> This method consists of replicating an image with squares as guides. This means
                    that you will
                    replicate square by square of an image to finally have it almost 100% exactly the same.</p>

                <h2>Love through the lens</h2>
                <p>This month posters were put up all over school about something called "Love through the lens"
                    this
                    consisted of sendind black and white pictures to the gmail provided. The pictures sent had to
                    mean how the "viewer" saw love, it could be something or someone. The pictures sent are now in
                    the cafeteria, covering part of a wall.</p>
