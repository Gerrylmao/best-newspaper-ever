                    <h2>Popurri future exhibition</h2>
                    <p>The art club is currently working on a future project that is repeated every year.</p>
                    <p>This project consists of an art exhibition that will be happening in Ciudad Juarez where many
                        students will be creating art pieces and they will be put up for
                        everyone to see in there. However this year it may not be called the same, so we will update the
                        exhibition's name once we confirm it.</p>

                    <h2>Grid assignment</h2>
                    <p>As some of us may already know, some the current art classes are taking an assignment on "the
                        grid method"</p>
                    <p>This method consists of replicating an image with squares as guides. This means that you will
                        replicate square by square of an image to finally have it almost 100% exactly the same.</p>

                    <p>This month posters were pu up all over school about something called "Love through the lens" this
                        consisted of sendind black and white pictures to the gmail provided. The pictures sent had to
                        mean how the "viewer" saw love, it could be something or someone. The pictures sent are now in
                        the cafeteria, covering part of a wall.</p>

                    <p>The Art club member's had to create a proposal that could potentially be used for the robotics mural.</p>
